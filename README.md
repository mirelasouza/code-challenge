This repo was created to propose an Cloud Infrastructure solution to delivery app to trace back the orders.


#About the challenge 

At Zé, we were facing the issue of not knowing where are our couriers, making the current status of deliveries invisible to consumers and to our internal backoffice team. Therefore, we decided to start the development of a new app, to be used by each courier, called Zé Entregador.
With this app, the couriers (its users) will not only manage data regarding orders that are being delivered but also will allow the retrieval of their geolocation information in real-time.
Thus, while tracking each courier current location, we will be able to proper inform the consumers where their order is, thus, reducing their anxiety and also bringing quality, confidence and value for the entire experience with Zé.
